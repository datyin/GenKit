# GenKit

GenKit is a comprehensive TypeScript project designed to streamline the development process by providing a broad collection of reusable utilities, hooks, and components. Designed with flexibility in mind, this project emphasizes code reusability and generic programming principles to ensure seamless integration into any TypeScript based project.

## Features:

- **Reusable Utilities**: GenKit features a robust set of generic utility functions that simplify complex tasks, optimize performance, and enhance code readability. These utilities cover a variety of common scenarios, including data manipulation, string formatting, numerical operations, and more.

- **Hooks**: This project offers an array of custom React and Vue Hooks tailored to common use-cases, reducing the need for repetitive code and improving the overall efficiency of your React applications. These hooks cover everything from state management, to effects, to context, to various aspects of interaction with APIs and other backends.

- **Components**: GenKit includes a suite of reusable, generic components that are ready to be customized and dropped into any React or Vue application. These components range from basic building blocks like buttons and input fields, to more complex components such as modals and data tables.

- **TypeScript-First Approach**: The entire project is written in TypeScript, providing static typing and other benefits such as autocompletion, type checking, and intuitive interfaces. This makes the codebase easier to understand, reduces the likelihood of bugs, and enhances developer productivity.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each utility, hook, and component in GenKit is thoroughly documented with clear explanations and usage examples. This makes it easy for developers to understand how to use the resources provided by the project.

## Use Case:

GenKit is perfect for developers looking to build scalable and maintainable web applications in TypeScript. Whether you're building a small personal project or a large enterprise application, GenKit can speed up your development process by providing a solid foundation of generic utilities, hooks, and components.

## Version Info

- **Major version**: This number is incremented when there are incompatible changes in the software, meaning that the software changes in such a way that it may no longer be compatible with certain systems or previous versions of itself. This could mean a complete overhaul of the system, significant changes to the user interface or functionality, or other changes that require users to alter the way they interact with the software.

- **Minor version**: This number is incremented when new features are added in a backwards-compatible manner. This means that the software has been expanded or improved in some way, but not in a way that would prevent it from working with systems that were compatible with previous versions. It may include things like new features, improvements, or non-breaking changes.

- **Patch version**: This number is incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made. These are generally small tweaks to fix problems or bugs in the software without adding any new functionality. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.
